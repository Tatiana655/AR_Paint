# Project AR_Paint

Computer Vision/Object Recognition Project using OpenCV.
The goal of this project is to develop a program that will recognize the skeleton of a hand using a camera on a computer using the OpenCV library.

## Project Description
The program receives the video stream from the camera on the computer in real time and highlights the area associated with the human hand. Then, using an algorithm for detecting contours and morphological transformations, the software improves the image of the hand and determines its skeletal structure. By defining skeletal structure, the ability to “draw in the air” is added with the choice of palette color and the ability to delete the drawing. The result of the program is displayed on the user's screen.

## How to use?
1.To run the program, you need to install OpenCV, Python.
2.
